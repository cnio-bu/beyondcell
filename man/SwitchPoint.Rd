\title{Computes the switch point}
\usage{
SwitchPoint(bc)
}
\arguments{
\item{bc}{\code{beyondcell} object.}
}
\value{
A named vector with the swich points of the signatures in \code{bc}.
}
\description{
This function computes the switch point of the signatures of a
given \code{\link[beyondcell]{beyondcell}} object. The switch point is the
(subsetted and/or regressed) scaled BCS that corresponds to the point in
which the normalized BCS in \code{beyondcell@data} switchs from negative
(insensitive) to positive (sensitive) values. The closer to 0, the more
sensitive are the cells to a given drug.
